# Smart AI Pacman Player

An academic project I did in Python.

I implemented an ensemble Decision Tree Classifier that learns good moves to play based on the moves in good-moves.txt.
The code that I wrote is in classfierAgents.py. The rest is boilerplate code.

## Running it

You can run it via `python pacman.py --pacman ClassifierAgent` from the command line in the folder where classifierAgents.py is.

### Please note
The code is written in **Python 2**, and you will need both **numpy** and **sci-kit** learn installed otherwise it won't work.
Both of these can easily be installed via these commands:
`pip install scikit-learn`
`pip install numpy`
