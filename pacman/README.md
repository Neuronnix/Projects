# Smart AI Pacman Player

An academic project I did in Python.

I implemented an ensemble Decision Tree Classifier that learns good moves to play based on the moves in good-moves.txt.
The code that I wrote is in classfierAgents.py. The rest is boilerplate code.

## Running it
You can run it via `python pacman.py --pacman ClassifierAgent` from the command line in the folder where classifierAgents.py is.
