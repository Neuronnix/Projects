# CONVERT TO C++

- [ ] Change from pointers to references where possible
- [ ] Change from char * to strings
- [ ] Change the IO to streams
- [ ] Change arrays to vectors
- [ ] Change game_state to be class with class functions (mostly done)
- [ ] Refactor select and how sockets are read from
    - [ ] Remove allset global variable
    - [ ] Maybe move socket ops to their own class
- [ ] Split up code to be more modularised so it's not all annoying. Probably put game loop into a separate function or class/file.
- [ ] Change error handling to more C++ oriented
- [ ] 

# Finish implementing functionality
- [ ] 
- [ ] If possible maybe change how FD stuff is read; may be different and cooler in C++
