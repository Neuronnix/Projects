# CONVERT TO C++

- [ ] Change from pointers to references where possible
- [ ] Change from char * to strings
- [ ] Change the IO
- [ ] Change game_state to be class with class functions
- [ ] Split up code to be more modularised so it's not all annoying. Probably put game loop into a separate function or class/file.
- [ ] Change error handling to more C++ oriented

# Finish implementing functionality
- [ ] If possible maybe change how FD stuff is read; may be different and cooler in C++
